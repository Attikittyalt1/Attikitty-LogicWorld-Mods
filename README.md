# Attikitty's Logic World Mod Collection

In this repository you will find all mods created by @Attikitty for the game Logic World.

**All mods in this repository are for LogicWorld version 0.92**

## How to install / use them?

This project contains one `project folder` for each mod.\
In each of these folder you will find descriptions (`Readme.md`) and further instructions like this one.\
Inside each `project folder` you will find another folder, which is the actual `mod folder` (contains the `manifest.jecs` file).\
You can copy/paste or `link` that `mod folder` to your `GameData` folder, where `Logic World` searches for mods.

You can ignore all other files outside the `mod folder`s.

## List of mods:

#### Client & Server: (Installed on both sides)

- `BoardPegs`: Adds pegs that connect via the grid on their parent board.
