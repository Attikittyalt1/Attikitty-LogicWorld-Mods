# Board Pegs
Adds pegs that connect via the grid on their parent board.

More specifically, each board peg has a hidden link to every other board peg in the same row or column as it. If placed on the side of a board, they only connect in the direction of the board and not to any other board pegs on the same side.

These can be found in the Miscellaneous/Routing section of the component inventory.
