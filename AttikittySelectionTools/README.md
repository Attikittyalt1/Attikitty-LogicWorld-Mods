# Attikitty's Selection Tools
Adds a few keybinds that improve your ability to manage selections.

These can be found the Controls/Attikitty's Selection Tools tab of your settings menu.

Current keybinds added by this mod:
- `Store Alternate Selection`: Sets your selection clipboard to the current selection.
- `Load Alternate Selection`: Sets your current selection to the selection clipboard.
- `Clear Alternate Selection`: Clears the clipboard.
- `Swap Alternate Selection`: Swaps your current selection with the selection clipboard. Currently this only works if both contain at least one component.
- `Add Alternate Selection`: Adds your current selection to the selection clipboard without overwriting it.
- `Remove Alternate Selection`: Removes your current selection from the selection clipboard without overwriting it.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `AttikittySelectionTools` folder into your `GameData` folder.

While there are no dependencies required for this mod to function, I highly recommend using the mod 'PrimitiveSelections'
