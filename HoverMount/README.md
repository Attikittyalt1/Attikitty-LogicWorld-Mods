# HoverPads
Adds mounts that levitate a component above them.

More specifically, each hover pad has a small one-sided white panel above it that you can place things on. This can be resized in order to hover at different heights.

These can be found in the Miscellaneous/Structure section of the components inventory.

## Install / Dependencies:

Just drop the `HoverPads` folder into your `GameData` folder.
